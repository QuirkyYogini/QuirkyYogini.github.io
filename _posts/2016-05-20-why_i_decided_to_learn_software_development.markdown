Programming is a lot like how I'd describe myself. It's always changing, it's fun, it comes with preconceived notions about what it means to be a programmer, and when something is wrong with your program, there are error messages with clues to get you back on track. 


Not long ago, I started getting a few error messages in my life, telling me that something is off and I needed to look back at my code and fix something.
I started looking at different career paths I could take and I heard about coding bootcamps. Years ago, I used HTML to build my own website, learned to count in binary, and had Linux running on my computer after my then-boyfriend, who is exactly what you think of when you think of a programmer, got tired of fixing my Windows machine. Still, I didn't take that idea seriously for several more months.

It wasn't until my current boyfriend mentioned two of his friends had successfully completed a career transition using coding bootcamps that I realized it wasn't a hoax and it was a viable option for people wanting to make transitions. Even if I don't fit the stereotypical description of a coder, it's a great match for my skillset and personality.

I love to deep-dive into challenges and the rush I get when I'm working on a tough coding challenge that finally passes is one of the most wonderful and empowering feelings I've had. It's my mission to continue learning and one day encourage others who think like I did, that programming isn't for them, that yes, if it interests them and they work hard, it most certainly is.
